# Rasterize
An educational software renderer in Python

Currently, there are two chapters:

 * Chapter 1: Pixels, Lines, Polys  
   Where we will find out how to make pixels, turn pixels into lines, turn lines into
   polylines and finally fill polylines into polygons.
 * Chapter 2: 3D points  
   Where we will find out how points in 3D space go into a screen.


## Note

All of this is completely ununderstandable without having been there during the coding. I might clean this up at some point (especially if you ask nicely).

Work has been started on this.
